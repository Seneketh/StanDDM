# StanDDM

A collection of different Drift Diffusion Models implemented in the probabilistic programming language Stan. 
A set of convenience functions for data simulation, model comparison and plotting are also supplied. 
The aim was to write and test "non-centered" versions of multilevel bayesian models which incorporate inter-trial 
variabilities and are able to process different amounts of data per subject. The package can be installed to use utility 
functions. Also includes random generation of parameters, data simulation and automated recovery for model testing. 
**To run the models on a server or cluster it is recommended to download the code directly from this repository.**
