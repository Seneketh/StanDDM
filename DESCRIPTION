Title: Drift Diffusion Modelling with Stan
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Marco", "Wirthlin", email = "marco.wirthlin@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A collection of different Drift Diffusion Models implemented in the probabilistic programming language Stan. A set of convenience functions for data simulation, model comparison and plotting are also supplied. The aim was to build and test "non-centered" versions of multilevel bayesian models which incorporate inter-trial variabilities and are able to process different amounts of data per subject. The package can be installed to use utility functions. Also includes random generation of parameters, data simulation and automated parameter recovery for model testing. In its curent state, to run the models on a server or cluster, it is recommended to download the code directly from this repository.
